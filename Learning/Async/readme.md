# Asynchronous Functions in JavaScript

## Introduction

Asynchronous functions in JavaScript allow you to perform tasks that may take some time to complete without blocking the execution of other code. They are essential for handling operations like fetching data from a server, reading files, or executing time-consuming tasks.

## Definitions

### Asynchronous Code

Asynchronous code refers to code that doesn't necessarily execute in sequential order. Instead, it allows other code to run while it waits for certain tasks to complete, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file from disk.

Asynchronous Functions

## Examples

### setTimeout()

```javascript
// Executes a function after a specified delay
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Delayed message');
}, 1000); // Executes after 1 second (1000 milliseconds)
```
