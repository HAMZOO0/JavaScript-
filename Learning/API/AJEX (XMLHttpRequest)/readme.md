# AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

AJAX stands for asynchronous Javascript and XML. AJAX is not a programming language or technology, but it is a combination of multiple web-related technologies like HTML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, XML, XSLT and XMLHttpRequest object. The AJAX model allows web developers to create web applications that are able to dynamically interact with the user. It will also be able to quickly make a background call to web servers to retrieve the required application data. Then update the small portion of the web page without refreshing the whole web page.

## AJAX Technologies
The technologies that are used by AJAX are already implemented in all the Morden browsers. So the client does not require any extra module to run the AJAX application.The technologies used by AJAX are −

#### Javascript :
It is an important part of AJAX. It allows you to create client-side functionality. Or we can say that it is used to create AJAX applications.

#### XML :
It is used to exchange data between web server and client.

### XMLHttpRequest −
 It is used to perform asynchronous data exchange between a web browser and a web server.

### HTML and CSS :
 It is used to provide markup and style to the webpage text.

### DOM :
 It is used to interact with and alter the webpage layout and content dynamically.

## HTTP Requests in AJAX

The foundation of AJAX is the ability to make HTTP requests from the client (browser) to the server asynchronously. These HTTP requests can be of various types, such as:

- **GET:** Used to retrieve data from the server.
- **POST:** Used to send data to the server to create or update resources.
- **PUT:** Used to send data to the server to update an existing resource.
- **DELETE:** Used to send a request to delete a resource on the server.

By making asynchronous HTTP requests, AJAX enables web applications to fetch data from the server in the background without interrupting the user's interaction with the page. This allows for more dynamic and responsive user interfaces, as only the relevant parts of the page are updated when new data is received from the server.

AJAX typically uses APIs like XMLHttpRequest or the newer Fetch API to make HTTP requests from the client-side JavaScript code to the server. These APIs provide the necessary functionality to create and manage HTTP requests, handle responses from the server, and update the web page accordingly.

Overall, AJAX plays a crucial role in modern web development, allowing developers to build powerful and interactive web applications that provide a seamless user experience.
